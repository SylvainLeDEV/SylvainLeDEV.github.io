# My personal website 

Currently in live  : https://sylvainledev.github.io/

This is my personal website / portfolio. I have done the design and the coding of this website by myself.
I have built it in order to be responsive and cross-browser compatible.

## In my website, you can find

 - my resume ( In header )
 - My Soft / Hard Skills
 - My experience ( More details of my experience. )
 - My projects (Whit on click you can see the code and the result)
 - In footer, you can find my email and my social networks.

## Technologies 

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

I used sass for this project, but it's not necessaries.

During this exercise, I reviewed BEM, sass, figma and a few others...
The carousel is without libraries, just simple javascript, I used my brain to create this.

So be lenient and enjoy!

Right now, I am letting my code like this because I have another project. I promise I will improve it in the future.
